// You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
// Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
// The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
// Exp:
// Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
// Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
// Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
// The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

// Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
// Output: [1]
// Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
// The result of the merge is [1].

//Interview Tip: Whenever you're trying to solve an array problem in-place, always consider the possibility of iterating backwards instead of forwards through the array. It can completely change the problem, and make it a lot easier.
//Approach: Three Pointers (Start From the End)
//Time complexity: O(n + m)
//Space complexity: O(1).
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        // Set p1 and p2 to point to the end of their respective arrays.
        int p1 = m - 1;
        int p2 = n - 1;
        
        // And move p backwards through the array, each time writing
        // the smallest value pointed at by p1 or p2.
        for (int p = m + n - 1; p >= 0; p--) {
            if (p2 < 0) {
                break;
            }
            if (p1 >= 0 && nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]) {
                nums1[p] = nums1[p1--];
            } else {
                nums1[p] = nums2[p2--];
            }
        }
    }
