// Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

// Implement the MinStack class:

// MinStack() initializes the stack object.
// void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
// void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
// int top() gets the top element of the stack.
// int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
// You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

// Let n be the total number of operations performed.

// Time Complexity : O(1) for all operations.

// Space Complexity : O(n).
